<h1><strong>Paper Reading</strong> </h1>

<div style="background-color: aliceblue; padding: 15px;">
<ul style="margin-left: 20px; ">
  <li><span style="background-color: #b98400; color: white;">important/interesting</span>: highlights important or interesting claims made by the author, so ideas that are important for their proposed that I want to remember or include in a summary I write.</li>
  <li><span style="background-color: #ce001c; color: white;">disagree/skeptical</span>: claims the author makes that I disagree with, am skeptical of, or know has been debunked in some way by other studies   </li>
  <li><span style="background-color: green; color: white;">agree/resonate</span>: is for claims that author makes that I agree with and that are relevant to work I'm doing, so these are usually quotes/ sentences that I would like to include in my future work   </li>
  <li><span style="background-color: #00809D; color: white;">directions</span>: highlights potential research directions </li>

  <li><span style="background-color: #725CAD; color: white;">chapters/headings</span>: highlights words/sentences with high chance of getting errors   </li>
  <li><span style="background-color: magenta; color: white;">confused/unclear</span>: Either I have no idea what the author is saying or I have questions that haven’t been answered that may come up later, and I want a reminder for in case it doesn’t get answered.    </li>
  <li><span style="background-color: #FF7D29; color: white;">connection</span>: is for claims that the author cites from other sources or claims they make that connects to ideas from another author. Use this hightlight with a comment to tell me, “Oh this connects to this other author or look up this source later.”. Or limitations from previous works lead to this paper </li>

  <li><span style="background-color: gray; color: white;">definition/concept</span>: whenever an author defines anything important, use this color for hightlighting, which is helpful for lit reviews because I can look at how different authors are defining the same term.   </li>

</ul>
